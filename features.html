            <h3>BigQuery</h3>
        </header>
        <p>See costs from 3 different perspectives: queries, tables, and accounts who run the queries.</p>
        <p>You can fine-tune the tableâ€™s partitioning and clustering setting based on the column usage statistics that Rabbit provides. </p>
        <p>Similar queries are grouped together (parameters are excluded) to see the most expensive queries. Get actionable insights and recommendations to optimize BigQuery not just for cost but for performance as well.</p>

            <h3>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Rabbit gives you a more granular cost breakdown on the cluster, namespace, workload (pod), and node pool level.</p>
        <p>Based on the past usage of workloads Rabbit provides actionable recommendations to fine-tune the requested resources or may change the machine type of the node pools to have better utilization of nodes.</p>
        <p>Rabbit uses pure GCP APIs to provide that information, there is no need to deploy any additional service into your production cluster.</p>

            <h3>Cost Anomaly Detection</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Rabbit is designed to aid in managing cloud cost events in a timely manner, thereby minimizing any negative impact on the business, whether related to cost or otherwise. Rabbit employs a customized machine learning model to identify any deviations or spikes in costs over time. Upon detection of any anomalies, the system sends out an alert, enabling the DevOps team to take prompt action before it becomes a significant issue.</p>

        <p>The goal of Rabbit is to provide clarity and transparency regarding cloud costs, particularly those related to networking.These costs can be extremely difficult to comprehend and identify. To gain a comprehensive understanding of networking costs, Rabbit collects all available information and presents it in an organized manner that enables prompt action to be performed.</p>
